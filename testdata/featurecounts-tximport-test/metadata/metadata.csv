511145	Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655	BHY173	2021-08-25	2021-08-25	PRJDB3140	RNA-seq to investigate bacterial responses to expression of a sequence-specific mobile DNA methyltransferase	DRX021104	Illumina HiSeq 2500 paired end sequencing; Illumina HiSeq 2500 paired end sequencing of SAMD00019994	SAMD00019994	SAMD00019994	The E. coli strain used was BHY173, a MG1655 derivative with mutations in restriction enzyme genes (genotype: MG1655 delta(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrB) deltamcrA). BHY187: BHY173(pACYC184deltatet).  This strain was grown in Lennox LB up to mid-exponential phase (O.D.600 =0.5) in two different batches. Then cells were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using PureLink RNA mini kit (Ambion). rRNA was depleted using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal kit (Gram-negative bacteria)(Epicentre). cDNA library for mRNA-seq was constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina). The indexed cDNA libraries were pooled and sequenced in HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina).

A dilution and replenishment protocol was then applied to achieve steady state growth as described previously [37], by removing 5 ml of culture and replacing it with 5 ml of pre-warmed M9supp.  This was done every 30 minutes for an hour for the anaerobic cultures, and every fifteen minutes for the aerobic cultures; pilot experiments established that this maintained the culture density between an OD600 of 1.8 and 2 (data not shown).  To impose the stress, 5 ml of culture was then removed, and 5 ml of pre-warmed M9supp at the appropriate pH with or without additional SCFA were added to create the specific stress condition.  Growth was then continued for 15 minutes.  Five ml of culture were removed from each flask and transferred to an equal amount of Qiagen RNA Protect and mixed thoroughly. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 4000rpm for 5 minutes in a chilled centrifuge, and pellets were stored at -80 C for downstream RNA purification. RNA was purified from the pellets collected as above using Qiagen RNeasy kits according to manufacturer’s instructions.  The optional on-column DNA digestion step was done for all samples to ensure there was no DNA contamination of samples. PCR amplification of the evgS gene was used to confirm the absence of genomic DNA (data not shown). All samples were checked ...
